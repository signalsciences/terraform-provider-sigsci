# sigsci_site_rule (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sigsci_site_rule" "test" {
  site_short_name = sigsci_site.my-site.short_name
  type            = "signal"
  group_operator  = "any"
  enabled         = true
  reason          = "Example site rule update"
  signal          = "SQLI"
  requestlogging  = "sampled"
  expiration      = ""

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "ip"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "1.2.3.4"
  }

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "ip"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "1.2.3.5"
    conditions {
      type           = "multival"
      field          = "ip"
      operator       = "equals"
      group_operator = "all"
      value          = "1.2.3.8"
    }
  }

  actions {
    type = "excludeSignal"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `actions` (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 2) Actions (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--actions))
- `conditions` (Block Set, Min: 1, Max: 10) Conditions (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--conditions))
- `enabled` (Boolean) enable the rule
- `expiration` (String) Date the rule will automatically be disabled. If rule is always enabled, will return empty string

- `reason` (String) Description of the rule
- `site_short_name` (String) Site short name

### Optional

- `rate_limit` (Map of String) Rate Limit
- `requestlogging` (String) Indicates whether to store the logs for requests that match the rule's conditions (sampled) or not store them (none). This field is only available for request rules that have a block or allow action.
- `signal` (String) The signal id of the signal being excluded

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

### Templated Signals
We have curated a list of templates for common rules, the full list of available signals is available below.

For these you must specify type = "templatedSignal".
Note that they will show up in the site "Templated Rules" page in the Console.

```hcl-terraform
resource "sigsci_site_rule" "testsignal" {
  site_short_name = sigsci_site.my-site.short_name
  type            = "templatedSignal"
  group_operator  = "all"
  enabled         = true
  reason          = "Example site rule update"
  signal          = "PW-RESET-ATTEMPT"
  expiration      = ""

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "method"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "POST"
  }

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "path"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "/change-password"
  }

  conditions {
    type           = "multival"
    group_operator = "all"
    conditions {
      field    = "name"
      operator = "equals"
      type     = "single"
      value    = "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// These are all of the valid values for signal
signals = ["2FA-CHANGED","2FA-DISABLED","ADDRESS-CHANGED","CC-VAL-ATTEMPT","CC-VAL-FAILURE", "CC-VAL-SUCCESS",
   "EMAIL-CHANGED","EMAIL-VALIDATION","GC-VAL-ATTEMPT","GC-VAL-FAILURE", "GC-VAL-SUCCESS","INFO-VIEWED",
   "INVITE-ATTEMPT","INVITE-FAILURE","INVITE-SUCCESS", "KBA-CHANGED","MESSAGE-SENT","PW-CHANGED","PW-RESET-ATTEMPT",
   "RSRC-ID-ENUM-ATTEMPT", "RSRC-ID-ENUM-FAILURE","RSRC-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","RSRC-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","USER-ID-ENUM-ATTEMPT",
   "USER-ID-ENUM-FAILURE","USER-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","USER-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","WRONG-API-CLIENT"]
```
If you do not see the signal you want in this list, check out the [Templated Rules page](https://github.com/signalsciences/terraform-provider-sigsci/blob/main/docs/resources/site_templated_rule.md) for some additional templates
