### Templated Signals
We have curated a list of templates for common rules, the full list of available signals is available below.

For these you must specify type = "templatedSignal".
Note that they will show up in the site "Templated Rules" page in the Console.

```hcl-terraform
resource "sigsci_site_rule" "testsignal" {
  site_short_name = sigsci_site.my-site.short_name
  type            = "templatedSignal"
  group_operator  = "all"
  enabled         = true
  reason          = "Example site rule update"
  signal          = "PW-RESET-ATTEMPT"
  expiration      = ""

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "method"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "POST"
  }

  conditions {
    type     = "single"
    field    = "path"
    operator = "equals"
    value    = "/change-password"
  }

  conditions {
    type           = "multival"
    group_operator = "all"
    conditions {
      field    = "name"
      operator = "equals"
      type     = "single"
      value    = "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// These are all of the valid values for signal
signals = ["2FA-CHANGED","2FA-DISABLED","ADDRESS-CHANGED","CC-VAL-ATTEMPT","CC-VAL-FAILURE", "CC-VAL-SUCCESS",
   "EMAIL-CHANGED","EMAIL-VALIDATION","GC-VAL-ATTEMPT","GC-VAL-FAILURE", "GC-VAL-SUCCESS","INFO-VIEWED",
   "INVITE-ATTEMPT","INVITE-FAILURE","INVITE-SUCCESS", "KBA-CHANGED","MESSAGE-SENT","PW-CHANGED","PW-RESET-ATTEMPT",
   "RSRC-ID-ENUM-ATTEMPT", "RSRC-ID-ENUM-FAILURE","RSRC-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","RSRC-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","USER-ID-ENUM-ATTEMPT",
   "USER-ID-ENUM-FAILURE","USER-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","USER-ID-ENUM-SUCCESS","WRONG-API-CLIENT"]
```
If you do not see the signal you want in this list, check out the [Templated Rules page](https://github.com/signalsciences/terraform-provider-sigsci/blob/main/docs/resources/site_templated_rule.md) for some additional templates
